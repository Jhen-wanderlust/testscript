PERPETUAL INVENTORY METHOD

                    Purchases and Sales of Merchandise Inventory are directly Debited and Credited to the Inventory Account.

                    Running/Weighted Average Cost is used in determining the Cost of Inventory during Sales.

                    This method is recommended as pilferage, damages and losses are properly accounted.



                    How to use the Perpetual Inventory Method in the System

                    In the Chart of Accounts Create an "Inventory Account" (Type: Current Assets) and 
                    a "Cost Of Goods Sold" (Type:CGS) Account

                    In the GL Set Up Option, Item Tab, Inventory Column, Enter the GL Account for Inventory, 
                    In the CGS column Enter the Cost of Goods Sold Account.

                    Every time a Sale is entered, using Running/Weighted Average Cost, the Cost of Inventory is credited from 
                    Inventory and debited to the CGS Account. 

                    When Merchandise Inventory are received, The cost of purchase is debited into the Inventory Account.



                    PERIODIC INVENTORY METHOD

                    The CGS is computed/determined only at the end of every accounting period.

                    A physical count of the Ending Inventory has to be conducted and entered at the end of every accounting period.

                    The Cost of Goods sold is generally determined by the following:
                    Beginning Inventory + Purchases - Ending Inventory = Cost of Goods Sold.

                    Purchases of Merchandise Inventory are debited to a Purchases Account.
                    No entries are made to CGS or Inventory during Sales Transactions.

                    How to use the Periodic Inventory Method in the System
                    Create an Inventory Account with Type “Current Assets”
                    Create the following Accounts with the type “CGS”:
                    - Beginning Inventory
                    - Purchases
                    - Ending Inventory

                    On entry of the Initial Physical Count (with Cost) check the "Disable Inventory Gain/Loss".  
                    This will cause the system not to generate GL Entries, so you have to enter the Initial Beginning Balance for 
                    Inventory manually in Journal Entry. You may view the Total Value of the inventory in the Stock Valuation Report.

                    In the GL SetUp, Item Tab, Inventory Column, Enter the Purchases Account, leave the CGS column Empty.
                    Which means the system will Debit into the Purchases Account (CGS) during Receiving of Stocks and will not credit
                    Inventory during Sales of Stock.

                    The Inventory Account(Asset) will not move since no entries are generated to its account during Sales and Purchases.

                    At the end of every accounting period, you need to do the following:
                    - Conduct a Physical Count and enter the data in the Physical Count Entry, check the "Disable Inventory Gain/Loss".
                    - Get the Total Value of the Ending Inventory in the Stock Valuation Report.
                    - Enter the following Journal Entries:

                      GL Account                                   Debit                                                 Credit
                      Beginning Inventory (CGS)     Value of Beginning Inventory

                      Inventory (Asset Account)                                                                    Value of Beginning Inventory

                      Inventory (Asset Account)        Value of Ending Inventory
                                    
                      Ending Inventory (CGS)                                                                        Value of Ending Inventory
